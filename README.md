# Juice WRLD - A React Spotify Application
_This project was initially built in 2018 but since Heroku-18 stack was deprecated, I redid the project with different a slightly different tech stack._

<br />

## Project feature
I'm a big fan of Juice WRLD so I had to build this application to show his top tracks and the list of his albums. Nothing too complicated, just displaying a list of his work through Spotify's API.

You'd have to have a Spotify account to be able to sign in and view the data but that's about it.

## Tech stack (2023):
* React + TS (with Vite)
* Taiwlind CSS
* Supabase (for authentication)
* Netlify (for deployment ⚡)

## Tech stack (2018):
* React
* Taiwlind CSS
* Node.js (creating the backend goodness)
* Heroku (for deployment 🐌)

## Install and run 🏃
```
yarn add
yarn dev
```

## Remember 🧠
This project won't fully work since you don't have the .env variables set in place. Make sure you do those first 👼 OR just remove the logic for logging in if you wanna see how it looks.
